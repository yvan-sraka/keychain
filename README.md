# 🔑 keychain
 
 I recently switch from Apple Keychain to [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org).

 I used `safari2csv.applescript` (that I didn't write, thanks to mike (at) cappella (dot) us) to export to CSV (plain text) my passwords, and next import them to `pass` using my small Python script `csv2pass.py` :)
